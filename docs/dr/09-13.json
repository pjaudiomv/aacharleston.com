      "To make amends can be viewed two ways: first, that of repairing damage, for if I have damaged my neighbor's fence, I \"make a mend,\" and that is a direct amend; the second way is by modifying my behavior, for if my actions have harmed someone, I make a daily effort to cause no further harm. I \"mend my ways,\" and that is an indirect amend. Which is the best approach? The only right approach, provided that I am causing no further harm in so doing, is to do both. If harm is done, then I simply \"mend my ways.\" To take action in this manner assures me of making honest amends."
