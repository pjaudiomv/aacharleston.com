      "One of the most important things A.A. has given me, in addition to freedom from booze, is the ability to take \"right action.\" It says the promises willalwaysmaterialize if Iworkfor them. Fantasizing about them, debating them, preaching about them and faking them just won't work. I'll remain a miserable, rationalizing dry drunk. By taking action and working the Twelve Steps in all my affairs, I'll have a life beyond my wildest dreams."
