      "The identification that one alcoholic has with another is mysterious, spiritual—almost incomprehensible. But it is there. I \"feel\" it. Today I feel that I can help people and that they can help me.",
      "It is a new and exciting feeling for me to care for someone; to care what they are feeling, hoping for, praying for; to know their sadness, joy, horror, sorrow, grief; to want to share those feelings so that someone can have relief. I never knew how to do this—or how to try. I never even cared. The Fellowship of A.A., and God, are teaching me how to care about others."
