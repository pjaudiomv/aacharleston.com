      "As a child I constantly questioned the existence of God. To a \"scientific thinker\" like me, no answer could withstand a thorough dissection, until a very patient woman finally said to me, \"You must have faith.\" With that simple statement, the seeds of my recovery were sown!",
      "Today, as I practice my recovery – cutting back the weeds of alcoholism – slowly I am letting those early seeds of faith grow and bloom. Each day of recovery, of ardent gardening, brings the Higher Power of my understanding more fully into my life. My God has always been with me through faith, but it is my responsibility to have the willingness to accept His presence.",
      "I ask God to grant me the willingness to do His will."
