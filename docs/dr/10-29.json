      "Thehonestyexpressed by the members of A.A. in meetings has the power to open my mind. Nothing can block the flow of energy thathonestycarries with it. The only obstacle to this flow of energy is inebriation, but even then, no one will find a closed door if he or she has left and chooses to return. Once he or she has received the gift of sobriety, each A.A. member is challenged on a daily basis to accept a program ofhonesty.",
      "My Higher Power created me for a purpose in life. I ask Him to accept my honest efforts to continue on my journey in the spiritual way of life. I call on Him for strength to know and seek His will."
