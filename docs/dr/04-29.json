    "quote": "Some may think that we have carried the principle of group autonomy to extremes. For example, in its original \"long form,\" Tradition Four declares: \"Any two or three gathered together for sobriety may call themselves an A.A. group, provided that as a group they have no other affiliation.\"* . . . But this ultra-liberty is not so risky as it looks.",
    "source": "A.A. COMES OF AGE, pp. 104-05",
    "content": [
      "As an active alcoholic, I abused every liberty that life afforded. How could A.A. expect me to respect the \"ultra-liberty\" bestowed by Tradition Four? Learning respect has become a lifetime job.",
      "A.A. has made me fully accept the necessity of discipline and that, if I do not assert it from within, then I will pay for it. This applies to groups too. Tradition Four points me in a spiritual direction, in spite of my alcoholic inclinations.",
      "* This is a misquote; Bill is referring to the Third Tradition."
