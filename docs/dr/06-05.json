It is suggested that we ought to become entirely willing to aim toward perfection. . . . The moment we say, \"No, never!\" our minds close against the grace of God. . . .

If I am unable, if my best intentions go wrong, if my desires are selfishly motivated and if my knowledge and will are limited â€” then I am ready to embrace God's will for my life."
