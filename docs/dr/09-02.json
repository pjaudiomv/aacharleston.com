      "A line from a song goes, \". . . and I look to find a reason to believe . . .\" It reminds me that at one time I was not able to find a reason to believe that my life was all right. Even though my life had been saved by my coming to A.A., three months later I went out and drank again. Someone told me: \"You don't have to believe. Aren't you <i>willing</i> to believe that there is a reason for your life, even though you may not know yourself what that reason is, or that you may not sometimes know the right way to behave?\" When I saw how willing I was to believe there <i>was</i> a reason for my life, then I could start to work on the Steps. Now when I begin with, \"I am willing. . . ,\" I am using the key that leads to action, honesty, and an openness to a Higher Power moving through my life."
