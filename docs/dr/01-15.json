      "From my first days in A.A., as I struggled for sobriety, I found hope in these words from our founders. I often pondered the phrase: \"they have tapped an unsuspected inner resource.\" How, I asked myself, can I find the Power within myself, since I am so powerless? In time, as the founders promised, it came to me: I have always had the choice between goodness and evil, between unselfishness and selfishness, between serenity and fear. That Power greater than myself is an original gift that I did not recognize until I achieved daily sobriety through living A.A.'s Twelve Steps."
