      "When I first discovered that there is not a single \"don't\" in the Twelve Steps of A.A., I was disturbed because this discovery swung open a giant portal. Only then was I able to realize what A.A. is for me:",
      "A.A.is not a program of \"don'ts,\" but of \"do's.\"A.A. is not martial law; it is freedom.A.A. is not tears over defects, but sweat over fixing them.A.A. is not penitence; it is salvation.A.A. is not \"Woe to me\" for my sins, past and present.A.A. is \"Praise God\" for the progress I am making today."
