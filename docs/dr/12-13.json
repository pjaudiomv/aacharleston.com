      "Thinking of others has never come easily to me. Even when I try to work the A.A. program, I'm prone to thinking, \"How doIfeel today. AmIhappy, joyous and free?\"",
      "The program tells me that my thoughtsmustreach out to those around me: \"Would that newcomer welcome someone to talk to?\" \"That person looks a little unhappy today, maybe I could cheer him up.\" It is only when I forget my problems, and reach out to contribute something to others that I can begin to attain the serenity and God-consciousness I seek."
