      "Only an alcoholic can understand the exact meaning of a statement like this one. The double standard that held me captive as an active alcoholic also filled me with terror and confusion: \"If I don't get a drink I'm going to die,\" competed with \"If I continue drinking it's going to kill me.\" Both compulsive thoughts pushed me ever closer to the bottom. That bottom produced atotalacceptance of my alcoholism—with no reservations whatsoever—and one that was absolutely essential for my recovery. It was a dilemma unlike anything I had ever faced, but as I found out later on, a necessary one if I was to succeed in this program."
