      "Freedom for me is both freedomfromand freedomto. The first freedom I enjoy is freedom from the slavery of alcohol. What a relief! Then I begin to experience freedomfromfear—fear of people, of economic insecurity, of commitment, of failure, of rejection. Then I begin to enjoy freedomto—freedom tochoosesobriety for today, freedom to be myself, freedom to express my opinion, to experience peace of mind, to love and be loved, and freedom to grow spiritually. But how can I achieve these freedoms? The Big Book clearly says that before I am halfway through making amends, I will begin to know a \"new\" freedom; not the old freedom of doing what I pleased, without regard to others, but the new freedom that allows fulfillment of the promises in my life. What a joy to be free!"
