      "How often do I focus onmyproblems and frustrations? WhenIam having a \"good day\" these same problems shrink in importance and my preoccupation with them dwindles. Wouldn't it be better if I could find a key to unlock the \"magic\" of my \"good days\" for use on the woes of my \"bad days?\"",
      "I alreadyhavethe solution! Instead of trying to run away from my pain and wish my problems away, I can pray for humility! Humilitywillheal the pain. Humilitywilltake me out of myself. Humility, that strength granted to me by that \"power greater than myself,\" is mine for the asking! Humility will bring balance back into my life. Humility will allow me to accept my humanness joyously."
