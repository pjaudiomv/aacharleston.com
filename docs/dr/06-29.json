      "The great discovery of sobriety led me to feel the need to spread the \"good news\" to the world around me. The grandiose thoughts of my drinking days returned. Later, I learned that concentrating on my own recovery was a full-time process. As I became a sober citizen in this world, I observed a rippling effect which, without any conscious effort on my part, reached any \"related facility or outside enterprise,\" without diverting me from my primary purpose of staying sober and helping other alcoholics to achieve sobriety."
