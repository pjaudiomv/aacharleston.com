      "A thousand beatings by John Barleycorn did not encourage me to admit defeat. I believed it was my moral obligation to conquer my \"enemy-friend.\" At my first A.A. meeting I was blessed with afeelingthat it was all right to admit defeat to a disease which had nothing to do with my \"moral fiber.\" I knew instinctively that I was in the presence of a great love when I entered the doors of A.A. With no effort on my part, I became aware that to love myself was good and right, as God had intended. My feelings set me free, where my thoughts had held me in bondage. I am grateful."
