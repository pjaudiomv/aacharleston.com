      "I pray for the willingness to remember that I am a child of God, a divine soul in human form, and that my most basic and urgent life-task is to accept, know, love and nurture myself. As I accept myself, I am accepting God's will. As I know and love myself, I am knowing and loving God. As I nurture myself I am acting on God's guidance.",
      "I pray for the willingness to let go of my arrogant self-criticism, and to praise God by humbly accepting and caring for myself."
