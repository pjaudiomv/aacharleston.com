      "When I was drinking, I deceived myself about reality, rewriting it to what I wanted it to be. Deceiving others is a character defectâ€”even if it is just stretching the truth a bit or cleaning up my motives so others would think well of me. My Higher Power can remove this character defect, but first I have to help myself become willing to receive that help by not practicing deception. I need to remember each day that deceiving myself about myself is setting myself up for failure or disappointment in life and in Alcoholics Anonymous. A close,honestrelationship with a Higher Power is the only solid foundation I've found for honesty with self and with others."
