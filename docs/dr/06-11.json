      "I can be doing great in the program — applying it at meetings, at work, and in service activities — and find that things have gone to pieces at home. I expect my loved ones to understand, but they cannot. I expect them to see and value my progress, but they don't — unless Ishowthem. Do I neglect their needs and desires for my attention and concern? When I'm around them, am I irritable or boring? Are my \"amends\" a mumbled \"Sorry,\" or do they take the form of patience and tolerance? Do I preach to them, trying to reform or \"fix\" them? Have I ever really cleaned house withthem? \"The spiritual life is not a theory.We have to live it\"(Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 83)."
