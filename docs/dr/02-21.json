      "When I first came to A.A., I decided that \"they\" were very nice people — perhaps a little naive, a little too friendly, but basically decent, earnest people (with whom I had nothing in common). I saw \"them\" at meetings—after all, that was where \"they\" existed. I shook hands with \"them\" and, when I went out the door, I forgot about \"them.\"",
      "Then one day my Higher Power, whom I did not then believe in, arranged to create a community project outside of A.A., but one which happened to involve many A.A. members. We worked together, I got to know \"them\" as people. I came to admire \"them,\" even to like \"them\" and, in spite of myself, to enjoy \"them.\" \"Their\" practice of the program in their daily lives—not just in talk at meetings—attracted me and I wanted what they had. Suddenly the \"they\" became \"we.\" I have not had a drink since."
