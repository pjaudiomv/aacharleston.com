      "The word \"God\" was frightening to me when I first saw it associated with A.A.'s Twelve Steps. Having tried all the means I could to stop drinking, I found that it was not possible for me to sustain that desire over a period of time. Yet, how could I believe in a \"God\" that had allowed me to sink to the deep despair that engulfed me â€” whether drinking or dry?",
      "The answer was in finally admitting that itmightbe possible for me to know the mercy of a Power greater than myself who could grant me sobriety contingent on my willingness to \"come to believe.\" By finally admitting that I was one among many, and by following the example of my sponsor and other A.A. members in practicing faith I did not have, my life has been given meaning, direction and purpose."
