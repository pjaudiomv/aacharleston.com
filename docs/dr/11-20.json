      "I ask simply that throughout the day God place in me the best understanding of His will that I can have for that day, and that I be given the grace by which I may carry it out. As the day goes on, I can pause when facing situations that must be met and decisions that must be made, and renew the simple request: \"Thy will, not mine, be done.\"",
      "I must always keep in mind that in every situation I am responsible for the effort and God is responsible for the outcome. I can \"Let Go and Let God\" by humbly repeating: \"Thy will, not mine, be done.\" Patience and persistence in seeking His will for me will free me from the pain of selfish expectations."
