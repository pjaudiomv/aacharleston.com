      "I came to A.A. greenâ€”a seedling quivering with exposed taproots. It was for survival but it was a beginning. I stretched, developed, twisted, but with the help of others, my spirit eventually burst up from the roots. I was free. I acted, withered, went inside, prayed, acted again, understood anew, as one moment of perception struck. Up from my roots, spirit-arms lengthened into strong, green shoots: high-springing servants stepping skyward.",
      "Here on earth God unconditionally continues the legacy of higher love. My A.A. life put me \"on a different footing . . . [my] roots grasped a new soil\" (Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 12)."
