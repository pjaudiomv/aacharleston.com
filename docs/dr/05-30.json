      "It is with gratitude that I reflect on the early days of our Fellowship and those wise and loving \"foresteppers\" who proclaimed that we should not be diverted from our primary purpose, that of carrying the message to the alcoholic who still suffers.",
      "I desire to impart respect to those who labor in the field of alcoholism, being ever mindful that A.A. endorses no causes other than its own. I must remember that A.A. has no monopoly on miracle making and I remain humbly grateful to a loving God who made A.A. possible."
