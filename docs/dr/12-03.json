      "I find that carrying the message of recovery to other alcoholics is easy because it helps me to stay sober and it provides me with a sense of well-being about my own recovery. The hard part ispracticing these principles in all my affairs. It is important that I share the benefits I receive from A.A., especially athome. Doesn't my family deserve the same patience, tolerance and understanding I so readily give to the alcoholic? When reviewing my day I try to ask, \"Did I have a chance to be a friend today and miss it?\" \"Did I have a chance to rise above a nasty situation and avoid it?\" \"Did I have a chance to say 'I'm sorry,' and refuse to?\"",
      "Just as I ask God for help with my alcoholism each day, I ask for help in extending my recovery to include all situations andallpeople!"
