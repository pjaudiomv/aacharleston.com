      "The \"Light\" to freedom shines bright on my fellow alcoholics as each one of us challenges the other to grow. The \"Steps\" to self-improvement have small beginnings, but each Step builds the \"ladder\" out of the pit of despair to new hope. Honesty becomes my \"tool\" to unfurl the \"chains\" which bound me. A sponsor, who is a caring listener, can help me to truly hear the message guiding me to freedom.",
      "I ask God for the courage to live in such a way that the Fellowship may be a testimony to His favor. This mission frees me to share my gifts of wellness through a spirit of readiness to serve others."
