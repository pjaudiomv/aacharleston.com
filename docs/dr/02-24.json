      "My sponsor told me that I should be a grateful alcoholic and always have \"an attitude of gratitude\"â€”that gratitude was the basic ingredient of humility, that humility was the basic ingredient of anonymity and that \"anonymity was the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.\" As a result of this guidance, I start every morning on my knees, thanking God for three things: I'm alive, I'm sober, and I'm a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. Then I try to live an \"attitude of gratitude\" and thoroughly enjoy another twenty-four hours of the A.A. way of life. A.A. is not something I joined; it's something I live."
