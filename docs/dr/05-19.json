      "The concept of giving without strings was hard to understand when I first came into the program. I was suspicious when others wanted to help me. I thought, \"What do they want in return?\" But I soon learned the joy of helping another alcoholic and I understood why they were there for me in the beginning. My attitudes changed and I wanted to help others. Sometimes I became anxious, as I wanted them to know the joys of sobriety, that life can be beautiful. When my life is full of a loving God of my understanding and I give that love to my fellow alcoholic, I feel a special richness that is hard to explain."
