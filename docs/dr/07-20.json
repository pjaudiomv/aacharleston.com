      "When I put the Seventh Step into action I must remember that there are no blanks to fill in. It doesn't say, \"Humbly asked Him to (fill in the blank) remove our shortcomings.\" For years, I filled in the imaginary blank with \"Help me!\" \"Give me the courage to,\" and \"Give me the strength,\" etc. The Step says simply that God will remove my shortcomings. The only footwork I must do is \"humbly ask,\" which for me means asking with the knowledge that of myself I am nothing, the Father within \"doeth the works.\""
