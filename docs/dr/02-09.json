    "quote": "How often do we sit in AA meetings and hear the speaker declare, \"But I haven't yet got the spiritual angle.\" Prior to this statement, he had described a miracle of transformation which had occurred in himâ€”not only his release from alcohol, but a complete change in his whole attitude toward life and the living of it. It is apparent to nearly everyone else present that he has received a great gift; \". . . except that he doesn't seem to know it yet!\" We well know that this questioning individual will tell us six months or a year hence that he has found faith in God.",

      "A spiritual experience can be the realization that a life which once seemed empty and devoid of meaning is now joyous and full. In my life today, daily prayer and meditation, coupled with living the Twelve Steps, has brought about an inner peace and feeling of belonging which was missing when I was drinking."
