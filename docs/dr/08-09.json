      "One of the key words in the Eighth Step is the wordall. I am not free to select a few names for the list and to disregard others. It is a list ofallpersons I have harmed. I can see immediately that this Step entails forgiveness because if I'm not willing to forgive someone, there is little chance I will place his name on the list. Before I placed the first name on my list, I said a little prayer: \"I forgive anyone and everyone who has ever harmed me at any time and under any circumstances.\"",
      "It is well for me to contemplate a small, but very significant, two-letter word every time the Lord's Prayer is said. The word isas. I ask, \"Forgive us our trespasses,aswe forgive those who trespass against us.\" In this case,asmeans, \"in the same manner.\" I am asking to be forgiven in the same manner that I forgive others. As I say this portion of the prayer, if I am harboring hatred or resentment, I am inviting more resentment, when I should be calling on the spirit of forgiveness."
