      "When I finally made my way to A.A., I could not believe that there was no treasurer to \"compel the payment of dues.\" I could not imagine an organization that didn't require monetary contributions in return for a service. It was my first and, thus far, only experience with getting \"something for nothing.\" Because I did not feel used or conned by those in A.A., I was able to approach the program free from bias and with an open mind. They wanted nothing from me. What could I lose? I thank God for the wisdom of the early founders who knew so well the alcoholic's disdain for being manipulated."
