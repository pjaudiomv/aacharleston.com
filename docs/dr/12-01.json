      "I remember my sponsor's answer when I told him that the Steps were \"suggested.\" He replied that they are \"suggested\" in the same way that, if you were to jump out of an airplane with a parachute, it is \"suggested\" that you pull the ripcord to save your life. He pointed out that it was \"suggested\" I practice the Twelve Steps, if I wanted to save my life. So I try to remember daily that I have a whole program of recovery based on all Twelve of the \"suggested\" Steps."
