      "A New Year: 12 months, 52 weeks, 365 days, 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes â€” a time to consider directions, goals, and actions. I must make some plans to live a normal life, but also I must live emotionally within a twenty-four-hour frame, for if I do, I don't have to make New Year's resolutions! I can make every day a New Year's day! I can decide, \"Today I will do this . . . Today I will do that.\" Each day I can measure my life by trying to do a little better, by deciding to follow God's will and by making an effort to put the principles of our A.A. program into action."
