      "I am fortunate to be among the ones who have had this awesome transformation in my life. When I entered the doors of A.A., alone and desperate, I had been beaten into willingness to believe anything I heard. One of the things I heard was, \"This could be your last hangover, or you can keep going round and round.\" The man who said this obviously was a whole lot better off than I. I liked the idea of admitting defeat and I have been free ever since! My heart heard what my mind never could: \"Being powerless over alcohol is no big deal.\" I'm free and I'm grateful!"
