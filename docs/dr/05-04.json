      "Honesty, like all virtues, is to be shared. It began after I shared \". . . [my] whole life's story with someone . . .\" in order to find my place in the Fellowship. Later I shared my life in order to help the newcomer find his place with us. This sharing helps me to learn honesty in all my dealings and to know that God's plan for me comes true through honest openness and willingness."
