      "When I did my personal inventory I found that I had unhealthy relationships with most people in my lifeâ€”my friends and family, for example. I always felt isolated and lonely. I drank to dull emotional pain.",
      "It was through staying sober, having a good sponsor and working the Twelve Steps that I was able to build up my low self-esteem. First the Twelve Steps taught me to become my own best friend, and then, when I was able to love myself, I could reach out and love others."
