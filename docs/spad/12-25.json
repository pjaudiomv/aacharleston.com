      "When we first come to NA, it's suggested that we \"look at the similarities, not the differences\" when comparing ourselves to our fellow members. As newcomers, this may have seemed like a ploy to diminish our uniqueness. We wondered, Do they want me to think I'm just like every other addict? Impossible!",
      "To our surprise, that recommendation has been key to saving our lives. It was important for us to see the similarities in our stories and to focus on the common ground of our solution. Instead of looking at our differences as disqualifiers, we learn that our diversity is our strength. As Narcotics Anonymous members, we have the opportunity to rise above, even embrace, our differences. Many of us find an unanticipated gift in recovering with people who don't look or sound as we do.",
      "But even more unexpected is how we learn to draw from the assortment of perspectives that we encounter in working an NA program: frequency of meeting attendance, the right number of service commitments, the difference between defects and shortcomings, and when we can start dating again. We learn from others, figure out what works for us as individuals, and make choices to benefit our personal recovery. We also benefit from witnessing and participating in, um, spirited debates about NA issues at business and area meetings. A diversity of perspectives informs our own dynamic contributions to our home group, our NA community, the Fellowship as a whole, and our personal and professional lives outside NA, even in our families.",
      "Unity does change us. It helps us to look for and appreciate our similarities and our differences."
