    "quote": ". . . when we are spiritually connected, creativity flows through us. This doesn't necessarily mean that we paint or make music (though it can), but that we can see solutions to problems and find satisfaction in doing whatever we do as best we can.",

      "Many of us develop a deeper spiritual connection as we dig into our stepwork, especially when we get to Step Eleven. We explore creative ways to meditate or connect to our Higher Power, and we discover multiple avenues for inspiration in our lives. Creative expression takes many forms.",
      "One member shared, \"Creativity is not just about art or music; it can be that spontaneous kind gesture we do for another human being.\" We learn that it doesn't cost a thing to carry our passion for living with us everywhere we go.",
      "When we tap into a spiritual connection, it can be like hitting our stride in a marathon. Somehow the world seems quieter, and our purpose in it takes on new clarity. Our path through recovery comes into focus, and it leads us into lives filled with meaning. We find joy in being useful to others and enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done.",
      "Our connection to our Higher Power helps us access our creativity and use it to amplify our service. We're increasingly able to discern the quiet voice of our conscience, a voice many of us identify as a direct connection to our Higher Power. Letting our intuition guide our creative acts of kindness is an art in itself."
