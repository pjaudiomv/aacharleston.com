      "Many meetings start with some readings from our Basic Text. They provide the nuts and bolts of the NA program: who, what, how, why, and other staples. As newcomers, we may find it heartening to hear that we're the most important people in the rooms. As we stay clean, we may notice the newcomer's significance--according to \"What Is the NA Program?\"--stems from what having new members in the room does for the rest of us: \"because we can only keep what we have by giving it away.\" This gem of a line from our Basic Text captures our interdependence as members of NA. We rely on each other, and our mutual needs fit like hand in glove.",
      "We all have a lot to learn, and not just at the start of recovery. Surrender and humility keep us teachable. We can take comfort in the fact that others have faced the same steep learning curve, stayed clean, and have experiences they're willing to share. The addict who suffers--new or otherwise--invigorates our purpose and reinforces the bonds of interdependence. We all get a turn in the barrel, and asking for help is our greatest strength. Other days bring a chance to serve; we get to articulate what worked for us and fortify our ties.",
      "We need each other--for the whole of our recovery--and our interdependence makes us better together. One member compared the strength that springs from our interdependence to the sound produced by a band: \"I love a lead guitar, but it sounds even better accompanied by a rhythm guitar, a bass, and some drums. Add some vocals and a horn section and now we're cooking. Sure, there's a place for a drum solo or a wicked sax, but a great solo makes more sense in the context of the band--not in a vacuum.\" Likewise, in NA, our strength relies, in part, on our interdependence. When we let others lean on us, when we ask for help from another member, when we cheer on each other's solo performances, we build on the strengths of our interdependence."
