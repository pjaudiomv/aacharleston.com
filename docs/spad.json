      "Active addiction is a grind, leaving most of us jaded by the time we get to NA. We stay coolly distant from other humans and much of life, hoping to avoid those pesky feelings. We think or say \"Who cares?\" a little too often, even for our own taste. Cynicism and apathy had worn away any optimism we once had. But then we get clean, and what we learn in recovery challenges this entire mindset.",
      "Experiencing the world with a sense of wonder is one of the fringe benefits of working an NA program. Some of us stumble on a new positivity when we start stringing together days clean. Others warm up to a new way of responding to the world over time or encounter wonder in sporadic bursts. But, regardless of the timeline or intensity, we recognize that feeling of awed respect and the newfound appreciation it brings.",
      "When we find ourselves thinking or saying \"Wow!\" it's a good indication that we're experiencing a sense of wonder. \"Wow!\" is a prayer unto itself in the minds of some NA members. It captures what it means to embrace wonder as a spiritual principle, complete with awe, connection, impact, and reverence in the space of three letters.",
      "Nature is kind of a show-off when it comes to inspiring wonder. Of course, we don't have to travel far to be wowed by a sunrise or sunset. But beyond nature--and perhaps more importantly for us in recovery--we find a sense of wonder in everyday life if we're open to it and paying attention. Moments of clarity--the clean kind--allow us to see our lives anew. Each time we take a moment to appreciate our growth, admire what's right with us and the world, delight in new insights, or feel all our feelings is an invitation to practice wonder."

Someone gives us a hug--to be welcoming, not for any other reason. Culture shock!",
      "Our First Tradition tells us that \"personal recovery depends on NA unity.\" We may not fully grasp this concept at first, but even so, unity takes hold of us. Somehow, we sense that we just might belong here. We take up the suggestion we hear at every meeting: We keep coming back. Some of us return to hear more of what members shared or read. For others, the togetherness we witness gets us to that next meeting. We watch as members embrace and let go enough to accept the hugs we're offered. We sense that we are part of something greater than ourselves and our addiction. We let go just a little. Despite our initial skepticism and discomfort, the spirit of unity encourages us to stay.",

That's especially true when we make mistakes: not showing up for a friend in need, unintentionally making another member uncomfortable, blowing off a commitment, using again.

If we smelled promotion, it would be a major turnoff. Many of us may start out skeptical, but desperation forces us to pay close attention. At first, the Steps, as read in \"How It Works\" at many meetings, may not resonate--they're not what we had in mind as our solution. But the stories we hear, the warmth we experience, takes hold.",
      "Witnessing recovering addicts being their full selves is remarkable and absorbing, and it keeps us coming back. Someone identifies themselves as brand-new--\"This is my first meeting ever\"--and receives a genuine, hospitable welcome. A member celebrates two years clean, made so precious by the fact that it took way longer than that for them to reach this milestone. Another shares their story of losing connection to NA due to family responsibilities and then rekindling their bond to the Fellowship, thanks to members staying in touch. Others speak about their addictive relationship with food, sex, or money, and about illness, loss, or lapses in judgment that have ugly consequences. And many others talk honestly about their struggles with stuff we can't control: a psycho first date, a mean boss, traffic, and the weather.",
      "We are paying attention to all these stories, their unique threads and common messages-- and their shared solutions often found in the Twelve Steps. When we work the Steps to the best of our ability, they help us undergo the profound change that allows us to stay clean and more free from the self-centered fear that can bog us down. But that's never to discount the importance of all the hard-won experience and wisdom we pick up from other members. Recovery isn't just what happens on our own with our stepwork. It's what we hear, see, and feel from each other. It's all of the elements of the program in concert."

As with our connection to the meetings we attend, we improve conscious contact with a Higher Power when we focus on the contact, rather than the distractions.",

If our mind drifts to the phone in our pocket (or the one in someone else's hand), we simply bring our attention back to the person who is sharing. In meditation, we simply listen for \"whatever's there.\" If we catch our mind drifting, we simply bring our attention back to the present moment. By focusing on where we are in the moment, we can resume our connection with our Higher Power. We listen, we share, and we often find that we already have exactly what we need."

In our personal recovery, vigilance often means paying close attention to our feelings, thoughts, and actions so we can catch ourselves before slipping into old behaviors or patterns. Our Basic Text reminds us that \"we are each other's eyes and ears.\" Our sponsor and other NA members can hold vigil with us by reflecting our values to us when we forget them or pointing out our bone-headed actions when we fail to see them. We need one another's vigilance.",
      "Our vigilance has a place in NA service, too. We strive always to adhere to the guidance of our Traditions, working to maintain unity, anonymity, focus on our primary purpose, and so forth. Many of us have gone through a phase--or phases--in our service to NA when we felt as though the Traditions needed enforcers, and we were just the right candidates. One member shared, \"I had been calling the local helpline and pretending to be a using addict to see if I could catch the volunteers making a mistake. Then my sponsor asked me which list of spiritual principles I found 'deception' in. I felt pretty embarrassed.\"",

Sometimes, those who disagree may treat us like vigilantes--people who take matters into their own hands. Other times, we might feel like vigilantes--like NA won't survive if we don't save it. Tradition Two reminds us to trust the expression of a Higher Power in our group conscience. NA is a we thing, not a me thing-- rather than enforcing our Traditions or trying to catch our fellow members slipping, we speak our conscience clearly and directly and leave the results up to a power greater than ourselves."

We did what we had to do--the footwork of using, perhaps--and had a certain degree of faith within the chaos of that lifestyle. But we don't necessarily bring those bold tactics into early recovery. Why then is it so difficult for many of us to have faith and get on board with NA from day one? Maybe it's that we didn't know what we wanted. We thought we'd found what we wanted in drugs, but total abstinence seemed unlikely and long-term recovery unfathomable. Yes, we want a better life, but who doesn't?",

Others find a single person to trust, and that drives our decision. Still others cling to our rebelliousness and then find ourselves celebrating a year clean, then five years, then a quarter-century.

We attempted to wrestle some sense of security and significance from an uncertain world, we put ourselves in a position to be hurt, or we clung to others in hopes that they might save us from ourselves.

      "Life in active addiction for many of us seemed like a battle: picking sides, winners and losers, retreating in fear from all conflict, or bullying to get what we wanted. We tend to bring this mind-set with us in recovery. Some of us confront and challenge more than we engage and listen. One member shared, \"I brought a sledgehammer to all my relationships. I felt it was my duty to pound my perspective into every discussion. Choosing my battles was a cop-out.\"",
      "As we mature in our recovery, examining our behavior through stepwork, most of us will figure out that \"we\" in NA doesn't really mean \"me, plus all who agree with me.\" When we say the \"we\" version of the Serenity Prayer in our service bodies and in business meetings, we're inviting discernment into the proceedings. We ask for courage, acceptance, and wisdom to guide us. Instead of approaching service meetings like gladiator games, we concentrate on cultivating enough humility to appreciate and learn from each other. We gain trust in others and become less invested in getting our way. We apply this newer mind- set in all relationships.",
      "We can also tie the Serenity Prayer to discernment in terms of prioritizing our time and energy. We can discern where our efforts would be best focused to change the things we can, accept what we can't, and let go when others want to make a different change than we do. We can ask ourselves whether we're getting too caught up in minor details rather than paying attention to the big picture and where we can make a positive impact.",
      "\"Sometimes the most discerning choice is to say nothing, step away, and let others step up,\" the member went on. \"At other times, honest self-assessment will lead me to choose a particular 'battle.' But now I try to approach a conflict in my life with spiritual principles in my arsenal and forego the sledgehammer.\" This strategy can apply to so many realms within our lives: sponsoring, parenting, romantic relationships, in our jobs, while driving, and, of course, in NA service."

When we were using, however, many of us believed that the drugs we used were fundamentally responsible for the positive contributions we made to our lives. Drugs allowed us to be confident about expressing ourselves socially, artistically, and sexually.

As we stay clean longer and gain greater relief from self-centeredness, we begin to see that the drugs weren't the only barrier to our fidelity, and we need more than simple abstinence to be able to truly be present for the people in our lives.",

When that obsession to use clouds our commitment to staying clean today, will we call a new friend in NA or our dealer? We hope for the former, but most of us, in early days, have reservations.

We couldn't see a way out or a future for ourselves-- until we got clean and began our journey toward self-support in recovery.",

But an NA group exists because it's made up of members who are practicing self-support in their own lives. In recovery, we learn to invest in ourselves and take care of our own needs. Instead of utter dependence on others, we look inside to find a well of strength and resources.",
      "We also take personal responsibility in situations where before it seemed that we were incapable of doing so. In fact, making our contributions to NA demonstrates our capacity and willingness to engage in self-support. We are investing in ourselves through our recovery community, participating in keeping the doors open for those who come after. This support of others keeps us aloft, keeps us going.",
      "Self-support isn't something we practice alone. When we talk about taking care of our own needs, it doesn't mean we're self-sufficient. It means we're engaging the support we need. We can turn to our friends, a sponsor, our Higher Power--all of which are elements of self- support. We are an integral part of that system, too. Because we're meeting our own needs, others can finally rely on us."

Waiting to feel like we can truly make choices for ourselves, independent of our disease, can be like watching a pot before it boils. We get a little freedom when we stop using drugs, but we gain a greater sense of independence by actively participating in our new way of life. We go to meetings, share with other addicts, and read NA literature.

Steps Six and Seven help us break our dependence by showing us what keeps us from making our own choices.

During our using days, we were rarely safe--even when alone in a room with ourselves. Sometimes we witnessed or experienced terrible things, and that suffering left its mark. So, how do we practice safety as a principle in NA? And how do we strive to create a safe atmosphere of recovery while standing firm on the Tradition Three proposal that all are welcome?",

We protect our equality by doing our best to provide every desperate and vulnerable member a safe place to recover. Without some sense of safety, it's hard to listen, even harder to participate, and our effectiveness in carrying our message of hope is diminished. A focus on safety enhances our groups' stability by creating healthy places that neither tolerate predatory behavior nor drive out offending members. Everyone deserves a chance to recover.",

Through this process of self-examination that is afforded to all of us, we pry open our minds to a new way of life. We inventory our pasts, so we can stop running from them and let go. We assess our shortcomings and assets to see ourselves clearly and to seek balance. We make amends to help us avoid the same mistakes in relationships. In addition to our minds, we open our eyes, our hearts, and our arms, helping others to seek change as we have.",

      "In active addiction, dishonesty was organic to how most of us functioned in the world. We did what we had to do to stay high; stealing and being manipulative and deceitful were among our strategies to meet that goal. We were chameleons more adept at figuring out who others wanted us to be than being ourselves. Our skewed perception was that the risk of being real outweighed its benefits.",
      "Lifelong habits die hard. In early recovery, we often find ourselves embellishing our using careers or whitewashing our wrongdoings. We are quick to justify our behavior, blame others, and minimize our feelings. Some of us continue to steal, cheat to get ahead, or promote a clean date that isn't quite . . . accurate. But every time we come to a meeting, we hear that honesty is essential to recovery. We know that we're setting ourselves up for relapse if we don't start telling the truth and acting with integrity. We hear that lesson in others' stories.",
      "So, we practice being honest in all of our affairs. We identify with other members--and vice versa--which encourages us to be more open. Our sponsor helps us to see that being honest is actually the solution to our problems. We adjust our stories to match the truth. Gradually, as our behavior shifts, so does our comfort level with the truth. The perceived danger we felt at being truly ourselves is replaced by the gift of participating in reality and receiving support from our fellow members.",
      "Like any defect, the impulse to lie comes back. Though it's not as habitual, dishonesty may be that rusty old tool we reach for in a jam. Nowadays, when we pop off a lie, it's painful. Our denial and justification wound us. Knowing ourselves and our defects well allows us to put some time between impulse and action. We are able to investigate the urge, forgive ourselves, and humbly ask for help to avoid acting on it."

      "The principle of consistency offers great benefits at any phase in our recovery, even though how it might look in practice evolves over time. Early on, consistency tends to mean a meeting a day for the first 90 days, as our Basic Text suggests. A likely outcome of completing a \"90-in-90\" challenge is knowing and being known by quite a few other NA members. Making ourselves visible in this way exposes our disease to people who see it for what it is. The compassion, concern, and care we receive from other members is a vital part of knowing we are not alone, especially in early recovery. Consistency allows people to know and care for us, and it can save our lives.",
      "The value of practicing consistency changes the longer we're around. Our lives improve, and we are able to practice consistency in other areas: NA service, family relationships, friendships, and any other place we go. Those of us who were able to show up physically for our family and friends find, over time, that we are able to be more fully present in the spaces we inhabit. \"I used to just send someone who looked like me,\" one speaker recalled. \"My family got a person with my face, my eyes, my smile. But behind all that was empty. Showing up for real in NA taught me how to bring the real me to other places I go. I'm not sending the imposter anymore.\"",
      "The magic of consistency in NA goes beyond just showing up. Simply dragging our body to meetings on a regular basis, whether that's daily or slightly less often, wouldn't be enough on its own. Something special happens in our meetings, though--we see and recognize each other beyond the surface level. We hear others share and we relate; we share with others and tell on our disease. Consistency helps keep us from going back into hiding, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. Our recovery depends on it."

We survived that time, in large part, because of our connection to other recovering addicts.

Taking action that's aligned with that decision begins with an honest evaluation of how we've lived our lives so far. Sometimes we get as many insights in sharing our inventories as we do in writing them. We go on to dig a bit deeper, examining how aspects of our character had become disproportionate to their intended purpose. We turn this bag of dirty tricks over to a Higher Power--and over and over and over again as we strive to be better people with help from that Power, whatever we conceive that to be. Taking another look at the harm we caused, we make an earnest effort to right our past wrongs.",

Our experience with the Steps means we're quicker to notice when old patterns of thinking and behavior creep back up on us. Oh, I'm doing that again. We may find that we've shut down emotionally, become disconnected from our spiritual lives, resumed a hurtful interior monologue, or taken up some other outmoded approach to life. We put in the work to restore wholehearted honesty to our lives and in our relationships, including those with ourselves and with a Higher Power. We tune in to reality, to the truth, to our higher selves. And we help others to do the same--to live and to thrive through the daily application of spiritual principles."

It can be saying what we want from a relationship--to the other person in it with us. It can be tolerating feedback from our loved ones and growing from it. It can be sitting in meetings with a group of recovering addicts and hearing each other's gripes, pleas, desires, and strides. It can be witnessing what makes us human and worthy of love and connection, over and over again. Intimacy is the result of all this.",

Other times, our feelings are less reactive; they match our conscience rather than our defects. In those cases, it may be necessary and right to address someone's behavior.

In the afterlife, he rails at his maker for allowing him to die, to which his God replies, \"I sent a boat and a helicopter!\"",

One member described their broken process this way: \"I put my needs out to the universe and ask for help, then I evaluate, judge, and reject the help that's offered. Turns out I'm often just looking for someone to cosign my BS.\" Open-mindedness will come in handy here, too.",

Listening in the same way takes a little more effort close to home. Applying the principle of anonymity helps us set aside information that interferes with how we hear others.

When we make an honest effort to fulfill our primary purpose--whether one-on-one, through a home group, or in some facet of our service system--we have the opportunity to reinforce the best aspects of ourselves. This is a benefit to us as individuals as well as to our common welfare.",
      "Selfless service calls on us to apply everything we know about spiritual principles. The experience we gained from working the Steps and applying Traditions comes to bear big- time. We learn a lot about open-mindedness when we work Step Two, for example, and then as we serve, open-mindedness finds a new purpose as we exchange ideas in a business meeting. Likewise, the importance of inclusion that we first encountered in Tradition One reinforces our belief in a spirit of rotation, making it a little easier to end a commitment. We practiced honesty and gained clarity as we inventoried our lives, past and present. This practice proves invaluable in service as we strive to foster healthy, honest communication.",
      "When we tend to our spiritual condition, it's easier to come correct to service. We've done the work and can trust ourselves to act appropriately. We're able to set aside the rigidity, ancient resentments, and impulse to control that can interfere with a spirit of service. Fortunately, we're not all sick on the same day, and a spiritually fit majority has a way of keeping our worst impulses in check. At some point or other, we'll probably get our turn to play the role of that difficult member. The good news is that honest communication has a way of neutralizing the countless forms that self-will can take."

      "Recovery in NA is a reliability game-changer. We show up to meetings regularly--and participate. We take on service commitments--and fulfill them. We communicate with our sponsor and other addicts--and we pick up the phone or return a message when someone reaches out to us. Through our stepwork, we gain some reliability skills that help us go beyond being consistent and doing our part. Others can depend on us emotionally. We're more reflective and self-aware, apt to practice gratitude, and quicker to forgive. We're more available in terms of time and our spirit, bringing our whole selves to our relationships. We listen. \"I have started to feel, even at my age--which is not young!-- finally like one of the adults in the room,\" a member commented. \"People rely on me for the first time in my life. Members seek my help, and I'll willingly give it.\"",
      "Put simply, when reliability shapes our actions, our relationships transform. When we're present and available in our encounters with NA members and others in our lives, people begin to trust us. They take our expressions of love and kindness with more than a grain of salt because we take actions now to back them up. We are works in progress, and we reliably allow others to be, too. Leading a spiritual life has ceased to be a theory we hear about in meetings; it is now becoming our own tangible reality--and we may even inspire others in the process."

We consider what we need or want, what we think is right, and what we are willing to devote our resources to. We take the time to think about benefits and drawbacks, time and energy required, other existing obligations, and whether we are willing to be willing when our enthusiasm goes away.",
      "Our past experiences with phrases like \"going to any lengths\" and \"no matter what\" were quite different from commitment in a healthy, spiritual practice. Even in recovery, we remain compulsive. As creatures of habit, we may find ourselves repeating behaviors even when we don't want to. This can show up in our commitments. We keep a commitment out of habit or because no one else has stepped up. We commit impulsively and then back out just as impulsively. Or we stick to an unwanted commitment, resenting ourselves and the commitment from start to finish. In time, we learn a healthier approach.",
      "The daily inventory of Step Ten can improve our ability to make and keep commitments. Reflecting on our lives each day teaches us a great deal about ourselves, including the types of commitments to which we are and are not well suited. Regular inventory helps us become more disciplined and self-aware, and we experience further relief from defects and shortcomings. We grow, and our commitments become deeper and more meaningful as a result."

We drew lines in the sand for ourselves over and over, and then we stumbled across them by doing things we said we would never do. In recovery, some of us find our lack of satisfaction can be almost like a hidden superpower: We raise the bar higher and higher for ourselves, leaping over past achievements by doing things we thought we could never do. Being difficult to satisfy can prompt some of us to achieve a lot in recovery.",

A worldwide network of meetings, groups, and service bodies are a part of the same whole.

Who we are spiritually and how we express that aspect of our individuality is unique to us, though we may use elements from all kinds of traditions, or none at all.

      "The service work we do in NA is all about carrying our message of hope to addicts seeking recovery. No matter what our beliefs about a Higher Power are, most of us can agree that anything capable of keeping addicts all over the world clean, just for today, is a power greater than any of us as individuals. \"I couldn't keep myself clean,\" one member shared. \"So there's no way I have the power to keep anyone else clean either!\"",
      "The same holds true with our service efforts: Our job is not to keep anyone clean or make anyone recover. We carry the message. Our Service Prayer was adapted from the literature prayer in the Basic Text, acknowledging the crucial role selflessness plays in our services. Many of us understand a Higher Power to simply be whatever force keeps us clean, and when we serve selflessly, we can be a part of that force for the addicts who benefit from our work.",
      "Selflessness isn't always easy. Self-centeredness will try to make our work about us, rather than those we serve. Maybe we think a certain service position will make us popular or powerful. Maybe we think sponsoring a lot of addicts, or the \"cool\" addicts, will lend us some prestige in our anonymous Fellowship. Maybe we think having the biggest home group or the best conventions means we are recovery rock stars. Some members say that ego can stand for \"edging God out,\" and there's some truth in that: When we allow ourselves to move to the center, we have to push something (or someone) else out of the center.",
      "The Service Prayer reminds us to keep the needs of the still-suffering addict at the heart of our service efforts. We do our part and then try to stay out of the way. We won't get it perfect, but practice helps!"

We believe that any addict can get and stay clean in NA, no matter who we are, what we've done, where we live, or any aspect of ourselves that, on the surface, would seem to separate us. To help us feel like we belong, we encourage each other to look for the similarities, not the differences; to focus on the message, not the messenger. We strive to bring this openness to visitors to our home group, and to meetings and NA events we're lucky enough to attend in unfamiliar settings with unfamiliar setups, in other areas, in other countries, in other languages.",
      "The universality of hope in our program and our message doesn't diminish the fact that there are differences among us, real ones. As important as it is for us to take responsibility to see past our own differences, we have perhaps an even greater responsibility to be inclusive of those who may have experiences or identities that depart from the group's majority. Actively including others assures a place for each of us and elevates hope for all of us in the rooms.",
      "To give hope to those who feel intimidated or unheard by the majority, some of us find it important to establish meetings that embrace a similarity of experience or identity. There is room for this diversity of hope's expression within NA; autonomy also ensures that addicts are able to find each other in ways that are welcoming and safe--and acknowledge and honor the similarities inherent within our differences."

Letting all of that go frees up a lot of headspace and energy.",

What we begin to understand, as we keep coming back, is that our fellow NA members are feeling our pain with us. We get each other. Our situations and experiences may be different, even unique, but our suffering is not. All of us came to our first NA meeting having fought to keep our addiction going and having lost that fight.",
      "Over time, the value of empathy is revealed. After we surrender to the fact that we belong in NA, it is others' empathy that makes us feel safe enough to accept help. We learn we don't have to hide--we can remove the mask we've been wearing, whether it's one projecting intimidation, righteousness, innocence, or invisibility. We can allow ourselves to be seen below the surface and accept that others do understand us. And in turn, we start to identify and empathize with other addicts in the room.",

They are clean and are taking responsibility for their lives, their relationships, and their choices. Allowing their empathy to affect us helps us to let go of the depth of our hurt and to see a path forward. Eventually, we feel grateful that we get to do that. Accepting others' empathy brings relief.",

One of the first things we learn is that the order of operations is different in NA. We had previous experience with the kind of accountability that comes after we screwed up. In NA, we often focus on setting each other up for success. To avoid missteps, we try to define tasks and spell out expectations up front, and then strive for transparency, communication, and support as we follow through. Having safeguards in place, especially when money or ego might be involved, can help protect our trusted servants and NA.",

Managing medication after surgery involves a relay between multiple members of a support group in many NA communities; transparency about pill counts protects everyone involved.

At some point in our using, many of us experienced a \"moment of clarity\"--although we probably didn't have those words to describe it. Instead of the usual lies we told ourselves, we encountered a sudden wave of understanding in which we realized some essential truths about our lives. The veil of denial lifted, if only for a moment, to give us an undistorted view of ourselves and the mess we'd made. It wasn't pretty. That brief encounter with reality stuck with us and wore us down until we were ready to try something new.",

We give our real name, take a breath, and add: \"I am an addict.\" This admission transforms a tired old excuse into an affirmation and positions us for the first of the Twelve Steps. With the Steps as our guide, we honestly confront the wreckage of our past and establish practices that help us maintain our connection to reality.",

Real friends support our efforts to be true to ourselves, to choose actions that align with our aspirations, and to help us spot when we're in trouble. \"I surround myself with people who aren't satisfied when I tell them I'm fine, when they know better. In public, they let that slide--they give me the side-eye and say 'really.'

As individual addicts, we decide if we qualify, and we leave that decision to others to make for themselves.",
      "As with all spiritual principles applied to any single Step or Tradition, open-mindedness is not an \"I got this\" position we take. It's an ongoing process that demands work. The excerpts from our literature that are read aloud in meetings continually confront our views about who is an addict or what is recovery. We need to keep reading them, hearing them, and acting on them. They support NA's values of inclusiveness and acceptance of all addicts no matter where we come from or what we look like; what substances, delivery method, or quantities we used; what's on our resumes (criminal or otherwise); whom we are attracted to; what our spiritual pursuits have been in the past (if any); and so on. We are all welcome here in theory--and, ideally, we're welcomed by each other in practice.",

For many of us, that's tough going, as in the past we've resisted becoming a member of anything. Our dual low self-respect and lack of humility told us that a group that welcomes us and is so open to anybody probably is for losers anyway, so why bother?",

Or hit our lit--work the Traditions in Guiding Principles or reflect on these entries every day.",

We describe our spiritual awakenings to newer members, but the explanations often make for more head-scratching. With most things in life--and count Step Three among these--we can't know the outcome before having the experience. The meaning of our decision to turn our will over to a caring Higher Power is lost on many of us. Instead of applying our brainpower, we need to nurture hope, faith, and trust.",

According to one member, \"Working Step Three is a decision to open a door. I may not know what's on the other side, but I've gained a measure of trust in that decision because I know my life hasn't fallen apart whenever I've cracked open that door.\"",
      "Trust is a conscious decision we put into action daily in some way or another by sidelining fear and taking a risk. We do our best, but some days acting as if we trust in a Higher Power is all we have to go on. Lots of us abide by a \"fake it 'til ya make it\" attitude. Along with faith, we take a leap of trust. Sometimes we fly; sometimes we flop. Growth can be a bruising process. We experience rejection or not getting what we'd planned for so carefully. \"Sometimes the gifts we receive in recovery come wrapped in dirt,\" a member teased.

We follow through on a long-held dream, rent our own place for the first time, enroll in or finish college, or start a family.",

Practicing the Third Step daily, from the moment we open our eyes, helps many of us to deal with life on life's terms.

What will people think? Better to say what we believe others will want to hear-- doesn't matter if it's true. Others of us have no filter and we spew whatever opinion we have at the moment--doesn't matter if we really believe it.

Thankfully, we've come to the right place to get some clarity.",

We lie less because we understand more. We speak as ourselves, not for other addicts and not for NA. Some begin their share with \"I'm not here representing NA. The program is in the book.

When we're honest with ourselves, we can discern what's relevant, how to navigate choppy waters, and what may not be recovery material. The clarity we gain in NA includes the fact that as individuals we can (and do) have plenty of opinions about outside issues--and we may need to share about how they affect our recovery.

Early on in recovery, I thought everything was boring and dull--but it turns out, it was just me!\"",

We bowl badly, make a big ruckus, and laugh nonstop.\" We experience life in a new way, and different life experiences shape our perspectives on joy.",

I don't even like kids, but those stories make me laugh, too. It's helping me not take myself too seriously.\"",

As newcomers, we may find it heartening to hear that we're the most important people in the rooms. As we stay clean, we may notice the newcomer's significance--according to \"What Is the NA Program?\"--stems from what having new members in the room does for the rest of us: \"because we can only keep what we have by giving it away.\" This gem of a line from our Basic Text captures our interdependence as members of NA. We rely on each other, and our mutual needs fit like hand in glove.",

We can take comfort in the fact that others have faced the same steep learning curve, stayed clean, and have experiences they're willing to share. The addict who suffers--new or otherwise--invigorates our purpose and reinforces the bonds of interdependence. We all get a turn in the barrel, and asking for help is our greatest strength. Other days bring a chance to serve; we get to articulate what worked for us and fortify our ties.",
      "We need each other--for the whole of our recovery--and our interdependence makes us better together. One member compared the strength that springs from our interdependence to the sound produced by a band: \"I love a lead guitar, but it sounds even better accompanied by a rhythm guitar, a bass, and some drums. Add some vocals and a horn section and now we're cooking. Sure, there's a place for a drum solo or a wicked sax, but a great solo makes more sense in the context of the band--not in a vacuum.\" Likewise, in NA, our strength relies, in part, on our interdependence. When we let others lean on us, when we ask for help from another member, when we cheer on each other's solo performances, we build on the strengths of our interdependence."
