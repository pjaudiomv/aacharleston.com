      "There is no such thing as a \"failed\" Twelfth Step call. Even if our prospect doesn't get clean, we have accomplished two purposes. We have planted the seed of recovery in the mind of the addict with whom we have shared our experience, strength, and hope. And we ourselves have stayed clean another day. Rarely does a recovering addict leave a Twelve Step call with anything but a deep dose of gratitude.",
      "Sometimes we are practicing the Twelfth Step without realizing it. When our co-workers or other acquaintances know some of our history and see what kind of person we are today, they know where to go when they have a friend or loved one in need of our help. We are often the best attraction that NA has to offer!",
      "For many addicts, the Twelfth Step is the cornerstone of recovery. We truly believe that \"we can only keep what we have by giving it away.\" The paradox of the Twelfth Step is evident, for in giving, we receive."

    "thought": "Just for today: I will remember that I am a living example of the Twelfth Step. I cannot \"fail\" when I try to carry the message to another addict.",
