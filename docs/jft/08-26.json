      "A daily Tenth Step keeps us on a sound spiritual footing. While each member asks different questions, some questions have been found to be helpful to almost everyone. Two key Tenth Step questions are, \"Am I honestly in touch with myself, my actions, and my motives? And have I prayed for God's will for me and the power to carry it out?\" These two questions, answered honestly, will lead us into a more thorough look at our day.",
      "When focusing on our relationships with others, we may ask, \"Have I harmed anyone today, either directly or indirectly? Do I need to make amends to anyone as a result of my actions today?\" We keep it simple in our inventory if we remember to ask, \"Where was I wrong? How can I do it better next time?\"",
      "NA members often find that their inventories include other important questions. \"Was I good to myself today? Did I do something for someone else and expect nothing in return? Have I reaffirmed my faith in a loving Higher Power?\"",
      "Step Ten is a maintenance step of the NA program. The Tenth Step helps us to continue living comfortably in recovery."
