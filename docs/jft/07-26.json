      "Most of us have tried everything we can think of, exerted every ounce of force possible, to fill the spiritual hole inside us. Nothing--not drugs, not control and management, not sex, money, property, power, or prestige--has filled it. We are powerless; our lives are unmanageable, at least by ourselves alone. Our denial will not change that fact.",
      "So we surrender; we ask a Higher Power to care for our will and our lives. Sometimes in surrendering, we don't know that a Power greater than ourselves exists which can restore us to wholeness. Sometimes we're not sure that the God of our understanding will care for our unmanageable lives. Our lack of certainty, though, does not affect the essential truth: We are powerless. Our lives are unmanageable. We must surrender. Only by doing so can we open ourselves wide--wide enough for our old ideas and past wreckage to be cleared, wide enough for a Higher Power to enter."

    "thought": "Just for today: I will surrender unconditionally. I can make it as easy or as hard as I choose. Either way, I will do it.",
