      "Many of us may not have understood the idea that \"anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions.\" We wondered how this could be. What does anonymity have to do with our spiritual life?",
      "The answer is, plenty! By guarding and cherishing our anonymity, we earn spiritual rewards beyond comprehension. There is great virtue in doing something nice for someone and not telling anyone about it. By the same token, resisting the impulse to proudly announce our membership in NA to the world--in effect, asking everyone to acknowledge how wonderful we are--makes us value our recovery all the more.",
      "Recovery is a gift that we've received from a Power greater than ourselves. Boasting about our recovery, as if it were our own doing, leads to prideful feelings and grandiosity. But keeping our anonymity leads to humility and feelings of gratitude. Recovery is its own reward; public acclaim can't make it any more valuable than it already is."
    ],
    "thought": "Just for today: Recovery is its own reward; I don't need to have mine approved of publicly. I will maintain and cherish my anonymity.",
