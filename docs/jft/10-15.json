      "When we were growing up, all of us had dreams. Every child has heard a relative or neighbor ask, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" Even if some of us didn't have elaborate dreams of success, most of us dreamed of work, families, and a future of dignity and respect. But no one asked, \"Do you want to be a drug addict when you grow up?\"",
      "We didn't choose to become addicts, and we cannot choose to stop being addicts. We have the disease of addiction. We are not responsible for having it, but we are responsible for our recovery. Having learned that we are sick people and that there is a way of recovery, we can move away from blaming circumstances--or ourselves--and into living the solution. We didn't choose addiction, but we can choose recovery."
